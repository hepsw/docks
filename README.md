docks
=====

`docks` is a set of `Dockerfile` defining docker containers for `HEP`
software and appliances.

Maintenance note
================

As alternative to the `Dockerfile`s provided here, LHCb also maintains their
own docker images at the [CERN gitlab container registry][lhcbcontainer]
together with a [user script][lhcbscript]. These may have more up-to-date
support for using LHCb applications.
